# Emulator

Contains the emulator for the gol-16. Can be used to debug programs. **Under construction.**

# Usage

Run `gemu` with a compiled program from the gol-16 assembler to simulate its execution:

```console
gemu program.o
```

# Building & Development

You can build the emulator using `make`. You can also use `make test` to run the unit tests for `gemu` while developing.
