# Assembler

Contains the assembler for my gol-16's custom assembly language.

## Inspirations
This lexer is heavily inspired by the C lexer featured on [The Vimagean][lexer-vid] channel. I have never built a lexer
before, so I used this as a starting point. The full source code can be found [here][lexer-source].
