# Assembler
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GNUGPL3.0-purple.svg)](https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0)

Contains the assembler for the Gol-16 Assembly Language (G-ASM).

## Specifications
To view the specifications for G-ASM, please view the [spec file][spec-file] listed in the main project directory.

## Inspirations
This lexer is heavily inspired by the C lexer featured on [The Vimagean][lexer-vid] channel. I have never built a lexer
before, so I used this as a starting point. The full source code can be found [here][lexer-source].

## Testing
The assembler comes with its own test harness, which includes a suite of test programs and a test runner executable
which reports primitive statistics. The test harness uses the assembler to compile a list of test programs from source,
and then compares the generated byte code to the hand assembled/verified byte code I've written. Any difference results
in error.

## Building from Source
The Makefile for the G-ASM assembler uses gcc and the header files that come with it in MinGW64. It has only been
tested on a Windows 64b machine. In order to run the `make clean` rule, you will need to be in a bash shell. I have been
using Git bash on Windows for this purpose.

## Missing Functionality
The assembler currently implements every directive in the specifications except EQU (and DIVS/custom macros). This will
be added once I figure out the best way of doing so.
